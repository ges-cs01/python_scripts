# python_scripts
Some useful small stuff.

## walk.py
    Usage: python3 walk.py

   List all files in the directory and subdirectories with their respective sizes. Very useful to pipe it with grep and find a file that you don't remember the entire name nor where it is exactly located. 

   To change the directory you're searching just change the argument in the os.walk("your/dir/here")
